# Tik Tak Toe React Exercise

This is a proyect for the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding.

The objetive of this exercise was lern about the inheritance of promps from a Parent conponent to a child one, and how to pass data in the opposite direction.

## Roadmap for Future Improvements

Currently the game continues to run after being won by one of the players. In this sense I will change the code so that it stops at that moment.

In the current board you can click and change the content of the squares, which should not be. I'll implement the change so nothing happens once the square has a value.

## Instalation

If you want to use this code, download or clone this repository, and write in your terminal (in this proyect root)one of the folowing codes:

### For development

npm run start

### For Production

npm run build
